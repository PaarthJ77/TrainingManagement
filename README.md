## Automations

### Business Rules, Client Scripts, Script Includes

Used for:
- Assigning tickets based on training type or requester location
- Enforcing field validations
- Supporting reusable logic via Script Includes

---

## Scripts

### Client Script

```javascript
function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) {
  if (isLoading || newValue === '') {
    return;
  }
  var regex = new RegExp("[!@#$%^&*!]");
  var trainingName = newValue;
  var result = regex.test(trainingName);
  if (result) {
    alert("ALERT, no special characters are allowed.");
  }
}
```

### Script Include

```javascript
var trainingManagementUtils = Class.create();
trainingManagementUtils.prototype = {
  initialize: function() {},

  getAssignmentGroup: function(requiredLocation) {
    var assignmentGroup = ' ';
    var grTOS = new GlideRecord('training_ownership_setup');
    grTOS.addQuery('location', requiredLocation);
    grTOS.query();
    while (grTOS.next()) {
      assignmentGroup = grTOS.assignment_group;
    }
    return assignmentGroup;
  },

  type: 'trainingManagementUtils'
};
```

## OLA / SLA

- Defined to enforce delivery targets for training-related requests
- Varies by urgency, requester department, or type of training

---

## Access Control (ACL)

- End users can request enrollment directly via the Service Catalog interface

---

## Dashboards & Widgets

- Offer real-time metrics:
  - Total scheduled sessions
  - Pending enrollments
  - Completed trainings per user/group
- Widgets provide snapshots of training health and workload

---

## Knowledge Articles

# Generated files
This repository contains generated files and a checksum.

If you find yourself unable to import your repository due to the presence of files edited outside an instance of ServiceNow, merge commits that mix files from different revisions, or other data that does not match the checksum, you may recover using either of the following techniques:
* Remove the problem commits:
  1. Clone your repository to a personal computer with the git command line tools installed and open a git command prompt in the repository root
  2. Run `git log` and take note of the SHA1s of the problem commits
  3. Build revert commits using `git revert SHA1` repeatedly, working backward in time, for each commit that introduced changes not generated by a ServiceNow instance
  4. Run `git push`

* Overwrite the problem code snapshot with a known good one:
  1. Clone your repository to a personal computer with the git command line tools installed and open a git command prompt in the repository root,
  2. Locate a known good code snapshot and record its SHA1. For this step, `git log` can be useful.
  2. Run `git reset --hard SHA1` to a commit that was generated by a ServiceNow instance
  3. Run `git reset HEAD{1}`
  4. Run `git add -A`
  5. Run `git commit`
  6. Run `git push`
